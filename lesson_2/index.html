			<h1>Hello my future buddies! </h1>
				<h2>Let me introduce myself</h2>
				<p> Finally I found a free time for conversation.<br>
				Firstly, I want to say that this interview is for me a kind of test of my ability to express myself in English,<br> how difficult it will be for me.<br>
				Therefore, do not judge strictly, this solution is a 100% experiment.<br>
				My name is Anastasia, I am 32 years old.<br>
				Now I live in the city of Lublin in Poland with my mother and black cat Misty.

		<p>
			In connection with the hostilities, we had to leave Krivoy Rog in April last year.<br>
			I have a bachelor's degree in psychology. But unfortunately, due to my health condition,<br> I have no work experience.
		  I have been in a wheelchair since childhood and can only work from home as a freelancer.<br>
		  Therefore, I want to change my specialty and find myself in a new profession. 
        I try to use every opportunity for self development and learning.<br>
		  I passing the course of learning cybersecurity and programming HTML/CSS, <br> study Polish language and create beaded jewelry.
		  I am currently learning how to work in a network simulation program Packet tracer,<br>
			I heard about Engin in a chat from participants in a cybersecurity course from Cisco.
		  I recently completed a Java marathon from GoIt.<br> Within 4 days, a patriotic telegram bot was created.
			I need the practice of communicating with a native speaker in order to feel more<br> confident abroad and have more abilities 
			for employment in IT field.I very hope that Engin help me to find interesting people for conversation.
